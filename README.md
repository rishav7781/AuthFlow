# AuthFlow
AuthFlow is a Truecaller-inspired authentication and contact discovery system built with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, JWT authentication, and Docker. It allows users to sign up, login, view their profile, and upload a list of contact numbers to identify registered users in the system. Fully dockerized and documented via Swagger.
